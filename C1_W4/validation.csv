__label__-1 "i ordered this after reading through the reviews . i realize the reviews were mixed but thought i 'd take a chance . unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress . right : i loved the various colors ( yes it shows black but is actually brown ) . i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress with the same hi-to-low hemline . wrong : as said by others the sleeves were very tight ! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model it is n't real"
__label__1 "i purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation . it 's such a cute fun print . i purchased my regular size xs and it 's a good fit . the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it . got it during the 25 percent promo .."
__label__0 "i so badly wanted this top to work . it looks so cute ! but as soon as i tried it on i knew it was n't a keeper . i did n't even need a mirror ! it 's not suited for those of us with a bust ( i 'm a 34d ) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame . i suggest sizing up if you 're busty and want to give it a try . it looked dowdy on me ."
__label__1 "the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design . it looks very elegant and romantic . you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps . it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering . the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath . overall very pretty and i would highly recommend . ( i purchased the white and yellow version . )"
__label__0 "love the style weight ( not too hot ) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans . i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue . very disappointed"
__label__1 "this dress is so flattering on i was astounded . often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though i 'm only 5 ' 1 tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall . the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring . would be great for work or church but unfortunately does n't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price . i highly recommend"

__label__-1 "this top was originally way overpriced . so i ordered it on sale for half price . still overpriced . it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed . the quality is not great . it is like a jersey type material . does n't look like the photograph at all . i like the color but frankly that 's about it ."

__label__0 "i really want to like this dress - it 's beautiful but it just fits like a sack . the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier . perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode or small chested it would be great ! the quality and color is beautiful ."
__label__-1 "this dress runs so large why did they not make an extra small . the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering . i wish wish that they made this in the extra small i was swimming in it there was no way to fix it so it went back"

__label__-1 "cute and very soft but the elastic was n't sewn in right . i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess . disappointing for more expensive loungewear ."
__label__0 "i love a good peplum top and was so excited when it arrived but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much . i 'm not sure why it was so unflattering because in every other way it fit like a dream but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly . it had to go back ."
__label__-1 "this looked like a simple chic blouse but the fabric felt cheap to me like thin lining fabric . the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering ."
__label__1 "love this top . great twist on a traditional plaid . looks great with skinny jeans or leggings . i get compliments on it every time i wear it ."
__label__-1 "i would say the skirt runs two sizes too small . i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews i purchased a large . i could barely get the skirt over my hips . even if it fit in the waist it was much too short on me and i 'm 5 ' 2 . it 's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween ."

__label__0 "very cute top and nice material but the fit is strange . there 's a reason that the model has her arms at her side . the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small but the body is very loose . the sleeves are full probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected . also the arm hole is wide so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt which creates an awkward silhouette . i normally love designs by whit but i 'm not sure about this one"

__label__-1 "i love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model but on me it looked tacky . i 'm 5 ' 6 and 130 lbs and this dress hit me in all the wrong places . i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress ( and the arm holes are already dangerously large ) . i wish this were just a little bit a-line . instead it 's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt ."
__label__1 "thin for this late in the season but the colors are so pretty . i 'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t top with a cardi and pair with leggings . runs large . love the the unconnected slip . 5 stars ."
__label__1 "this dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out . it so comfy and versatile . will never go out of style . it does run large but that is just the style of the dress . it really is the perfect summer dress ."
__label__1 "i wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments . not only is this a very pretty style the poncho is comfortable . i really glad i purchased ."
__label__-1 "totally bummed . the pretty print does n't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress . makes you look really top heavy and even the print which looks so cute online looks muddled in person . sadly went right back ."

__label__1 "i just received this coat and love it . the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue ( which i wanted ) but in truth the coat is a basic navy . this was not a deal breaker for me . i love the details . it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it 's not meant to be a heavy winter coat . i ca n't wait to wear it with jeans boots and a striped or plaid tunic ."
__label__-1 "material is thin with a fleece like feeling on the inside . hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material . the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward shows way too much would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath ."

__label__0 "i want to love this shirt but it is n't happening . the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting . the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great if the fit works for you ."
__label__0 "i ended up returning it just because it did n't do much for my current postnatal figure but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique !"
__label__0 "beautiful dress but it just did n't look that flattering on me . the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture . unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it . the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off i definitely do n't !"
__label__1 "these jeans are perfect in every way . i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos . they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them . i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on . they look great - highly recommend ."

__label__1 "this top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured nice pattern and could be dressed up or down the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch however the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top sadly i think i may send it back ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this top but there is way too much fabric . it looks nothing like the pictures . it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top . i 'll be returning this one ."
__label__1 "saturday/sunday never disappoints ! love this black cardigan . runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me . not a problem anywhere else though . good medium weight to the fabric . durable quality and waist flattering once tied . great for throwing on over a dress wearing with a t-shirt"
__label__-1 "i got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy . the prior reviews stated it was warm and cozy and not itchy at all but i found it to be uncomfortably so . the dress was true to size for me and the length was good . i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough . the material reminded me of mohair ."

__label__0 "i expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it is n't . i ordered the xs and i 'm swimming in it ( i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 lb ) . would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you 're wrapped in grandma 's table runner ."

__label__-1 "this might look good on you if you are very tall and slim . i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places . the color is not true : it is black stripes on gray ( not cream ) . i thought the stripes might flatter my shape but alas i did not look good in this . the material is very nice soft and stretchy ."
__label__1 "i purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac . the fit is amazing the length is great ( i 'm 5 ' 5 and it hits me a couple inches above the knee ) and it is a great spring staple . my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily . easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron ."

__label__1 "i do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable ! true to size and nice length . the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute . nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material ; more like a crepe . very nice !"

__label__0 "i ordered a size 4 my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow . the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving . i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long . i do n't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy ."
__label__-1 "this dress is gorgeous as displayed at store . color is vibrant but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily . i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived . the top is very wide and best to wear strapless ."

__label__-1 "i wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed . first the pink was way to sheer for my liking . the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area . then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect . a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit . the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks ."
__label__0 "i have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs . i am 5 ' 2 and ordered a petite but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long . as compared to how they look on the model . also the rise is relatively low . otherwise the quality is great and the denim is very soft . i will probably return these given that i am not wowed ."
__label__-1 "i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it . i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it . the fabric is made of cheap poly that 's shiny thin and clingy . it shows every lump and bump you have . the zipper at the back wo n't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump . the sewing and hemline is uneven . there was n't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline"

__label__-1 "this dress fits awfully . it 's not short as pictured in photo . it hit just above my knees . it looked like sack . i would 've also felt like i was choking all night with it clasped around my neck . it potentially may look okay on someone who is very tall skinny and lanky but i have my doubts about that too ."
__label__1 "just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it . i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer . i am 5 ' 5 and 140 lbs . i took a small which is my usual size at retailer . could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank . i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer but that does n't bother me . another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us . i will wear this all summer long . looks great with denim . happy find !"
__label__0 "i ordered this after seeing the rave reviews . it is not for me . just like the culottes i ordered this romper makes me feel like a grandma . i said i 'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again this was not for me . i also did n't like the back of the romper . no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it 's so low cut . the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric . tts also . i 'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this ."
__label__0 "tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering . the liner was fine but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent . tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick ."
__label__0 "i wanted so badly for this dress to work on me . the design is amazing . the detail is so pretty and delicate . its my version of the perfect little black dress ! however i have very big arms ... and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all . i 'm usually a 14-16 in dresses . i tried the 16 and it just did n't work . the arms were way too tight . however i 've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me and they"
__label__-1 "i was really eager to receive this sweater i was expecting the same as in the picture . i received it today and i am already returning it . first of all the sweater did n't look new it is mostly shapeless it has little balls and piling on the wool ( what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months ) and the metallic color makes it look cheap . in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places . it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col"
__label__1 "this is a really great top . it is really soft and made very well . it could be a casual top with jeans or dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels . i was n't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large . i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big but it does n't have that look at all . it looks so much better in person than on the computer . overall a very cute top !"
__label__-1 "and this one proved to be no different . the short end of it ; this dress is pretty much super thick heavy linen with a rope like collar ( the supposed embroidery you see ) and there is no lining but completely unnecessary pockets . i 'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer ( 5 ' 7 & a super fit 135 lbs ) and knew enough to order an xs in this however it still fit like a potato sack . even upon taking it out of the plastic bag i knew it was going back . between the unrealistic pictures and lack"
__label__0 "ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust . i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl . i 'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding . this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type ."
__label__0 "i am a huge pilcro fan . however these were beyond large . i am not even sure that the next size down would work . keep this in mind if you attempt these pants ."
__label__-1 "i am a 32dd 5 ' 4 '' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy . it looked awful . this is shapeless and oversized . i would size down or just pass ."
__label__-1 "when i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned . i got the black w the white collar/cuffs . i thought it was terribly itchy material ( which could be remedied w a shirt underneath ) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color . maybe the other colors are better ?"
__label__1 "this top is beautifully made but comfortable . the neckline is a stretch fabric and the cut is very flattering . the length is just short enough that it does n't look like a dress ."
__label__1 "i love these shorts . they 're really comfortable and versatile . i got them on sale and for the price they were a steal ! the material is nice and you can dress them up or down ."
__label__0 "i loved this jumpsuit . it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame . i did prefer a belt which emphasized my shape . unfortunately it is not lined and a bit sheer . this was a deal breaker for me ."
__label__0 "very nice top like the linen fabric . i ordered my regular size m and its huge . makes me look larger than i am and i will be returning it . i would like a size s i think just not a flattering oversize fit for me"
__label__-1 "this skirt was horrible on me . it was loose in the waist tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom . the material also felt cheap and clingy . i guess the fit is tts but it 's hard to tell given how strange the cut was ."
__label__0 "i know this is supposed to be a loose flowy fit which is exactly the style i love . however this is beyond tent-like . i 'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small . fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper . huge bummer especially after seeing a few 5-stars ."
__label__1 "i hated to send this dress back but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress . sent it back . it is meant for taller and more slender women ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love these because i love my other steps but they did not feel or fit the same way at all . i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white . these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me . sadly these will be going back ."
__label__-1 "weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel . needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing . not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash ."
__label__0 "i 'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants . i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me . it is double-lined but i could still see my bra . very pretty though and i was disappointed that it did n't work for me ."
__label__0 "i was so excited when this dress arrived today . as other reviewers have mentioned the fabric is lovely soft and drapey and it feels great on . it felt great that is until i looked in the mirror . while the dress fit fine i have a large bust and the fabric stretched across the bust causing the print to appear washed out across the bust . not a good look . sigh . another return ."
__label__1 "this was an impulse purchase for me . a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me . i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring . this one did the trick ! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing . the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support . i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day . the jumpsuit is l"
__label__0 "this dress fit perfectly i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well . i do however think that the dress is over priced . for as often as you would wear this dress ( given that is n't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once ) i think the price is way too high . a must have on sale or clearance but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination we will see t"
__label__-1 "then this one is for you ! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale . based upon the pictures i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail but it is actually masking this skirt 's ugly secret : a pouch . yes it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen which does not lay flat . the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots . this one"
__label__-1 "i purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves ! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear ! it went back i hate dolman sleeves ."
__label__-1 "i 'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5 ' 9 it is slightly cropped on her but it certainly does n't look super cropped . i 'm 5 ' 4 and its super cropped on me . even with high waist jeans . also it is incredibly itchy . i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami . too bad its a cute design just needs some tweaking ."
__label__1 "this skirt is perfect ! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth . the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch . i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year 's eve and had many compliments ! it runs a tad big . i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected . i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway . my new favorite !"
__label__-1 "this tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole . first of all the armhole is way too low ! second there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm . since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem . no need for the side zipper it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side ."
__label__1 "it 's hard to go wrong with the charlie 's especially in this fabric keep them coming ! ! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well . they fit pretty true to size i 'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well they stretch out a little so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind . because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric . try wearing a burnt orange green or pink ( the isabella sinclair grid wrap but"
__label__1 "i 'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy . it it absolutely adorable and the classic plaid is timeless . as first reviewer said the styling of this on the model does it no favors . it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering forgiving way . the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section then flares out on the bottom section . that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern subtle and flattering fashion . and the mater"

__label__1 "i love every other byron lars dress i 've bought and this was a no brainer for me . when it arrived i was really disappointed . the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick . with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does . nope . only the back buttons open . thick stretchy fabric and back buttons ... not an easy thing to navigate . i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m"
__label__-1 "i bought this top in black . it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back . however not only are the armholes are too large the shirt is cut too short . if i size down for smaller armholes it becomes a crop top not a flattering look for 50-something me . i really wanted this to work but alas it went back ."
__label__-1 "recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality . the fabric was very thin easily stretched out of shape . price is ridiculous for this item !"
__label__0 "i was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture . the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking . i 'm 5 ' 9 32c and i wear 28 size pants usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one . i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big . i probably could have gone down a size but i was n't loving it enough to try . the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much . the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer and would work in an office . but on me the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms ( saggy or fat area ) in a comical manner . if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad the couldnt have done it better . further the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point ( i am hourglass ) . again not flattering"
__label__0 "ugh . i was so excited to get this dress and for 30 % off . this dress is adorable . unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls . otherwise the fit was perfect . very disappointed in the top of this dress ."
__label__1 "i purchased this online and absolutely love this : : : : it can be dressed up or down . i received many compliments its also so soft and very comfortable ! ! ! a must have ! !"
__label__0 "ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture . the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear . makes you look wider than you are ! pocket on front are also large which accentuate thighs . these were returned immediately as it did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "but like other reviewers said it looks nothing like the picture of the model . i am 5 ' 3 and 110 lbs i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material it looks like i 'm 6 months pregnant . and i usually love loose dresses like this but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes . so bummed because the material is beautiful and i lo"
__label__1 "i normally wear a 4 and that technically fit if i did n't plan to sit . i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe . it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress . needless to say i 'll wear it on our next date .."

__label__0 "i 'm still on the fence about these . i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker . they just feel too flimsy and too much like i 'm ready for bed . i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i was n't wearing pjs . i just ca n't get past that . they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear . i ordered the small which fit fine . i wear 4-6 in retailer pants . i got the p"
__label__1 "i 've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one ! ! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size ( small ) . i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store . it 's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it . you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings ."
__label__0 "i think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs . i 'm 5 ' 7 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby . the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim . i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size ."
__label__0 "this dress is beautiful . very vibrant and rich looking ... however after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair . when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt . not attractive . i wanted to love it but it 's going back ."
__label__1 "i just received this in the wine color and it 's gorgeous ! it fits well and is very pretty . it can be dressed up or down . i ca n't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this . i have already ordered the other color ! great purchase ."
__label__1 "this sweater is lovely ! i have worn it every other day since i got it . it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with . i have gotten compliments every time i 've worn it . my daughter who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear said i looked like a winter princess in this ! it is so flattering and comfortable -- -a winning combination !"
__label__0 "i love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height ( 5 ' 4 ) . i 'm thinking about having it altered not sure if i will do that or return it . i love the colors and the back cut out it may be a better length for taller individuals ."
__label__-1 "i ordered two sizes . when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin . both shirts were in the bag . the style is just okay . the shirt is extremely light weight . i was not impressed with the fabric . i am returning both . definitely did not think it was worth the price ."
__label__0 "gorgeous color ! salmon not pink though ! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful ! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all ! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath . does not fit like the model !"

__label__-1 "i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful . i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together ? aside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large . the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked ( and felt ) huge . needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale ."
__label__1 "i thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging ' style . i am 5 ' 7 athletic and the small fit perfect ."
__label__0 "this top may be right for some but it did not work for me . i 've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one . however it did n't do much to flatter my body . i ordered the xl but it was huge . i 'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available . i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big . the quality is great and style so pretty though . i wish it had worked for me !"
__label__0 "i thought i 'd like this dress in the neutral color . i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering . the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape did n't help . the top fit well in my usual 4 petite i think it would look nice on some people as it 's something different but i am not one of those it worked on ."
__label__0 "this blazer is a nice weight for summer . it is more terracotta than rose but is still a nice color . the fit is tts and flattering . however the buttons were almost falling off the one i received . i did n't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it ."
__label__1 "these are the best trousers i have bought in a long time ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist -- not enough to size down . i love that they are not skinny -- so over the skinny fit . i plan to wear these with black heels white tee and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time -- oh and a statement necklace -- always a statement necklace . these are a must for every fall wardrobe ! more pants like these please !"

__label__-1 "i read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me but it did not . i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big . it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame . overall it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else ! if you 're tall and slender i think this top would work !"
__label__0 "i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide . they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex . the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange . for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs ."

__label__1 "was hoping i was going to love this top and i did . its a fun piece to dress up or down ."
__label__0 "this top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between . to be truly slimming & flattering it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend to make it heavier & bouncier . then it would hang appropriately and swing and ( hopefully ) not add pounds to the wearer . unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material . pass ."
__label__-1 "i usually wear a medium and bought a small . it fit ok but had no shape and was not flattering . i love baby doll dresses and tops but this was a tent . my daughter saw me try it on and said that 's a piece of tablecloth . it 's going back ."

__label__0 "i had high hopes for this coat but it was a miss for me . while the wool is soft and not itchy the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy . also the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located . i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was but alas i just could not get over the poor tailoring . for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs ) and it was big ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it just did n't fit in anyway . i ordered an xs petite and it was very large . the lacing in the back is completely useless and that 's what i liked about the dress . i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top ( because of chest ) and then lace more tightly near the waist . it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering . beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit ."

__label__-1 "this dress is really nice and lightweight . the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely . but .. it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves . it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering . i really wanted to like it because it 's so breezy but a tad matronly on me ."
__label__1 "i was able to purchase this on sale and i 'm so glad i did . i usually go between a size s and m ( 133 lbs . 5 ' 5 34 d ) but the small fits perfectly . the color really is n't dark orange as stated ...... kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color . it 's not super heavy weight but not really thin either .... actually perfect !"

__label__0 "oh how i wanted this skirt to work .... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful . the style is very nice . the knit is comfortable . but ... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away . after wearing it for an hour the front slit was curling in weird directions . the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y . i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips ."

__label__-1 "this jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big . i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there this went back"

__label__1 "this is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath and will be fun in the summer too . i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out and it was still really cute . great cut and design . as others have mentioned the quality could be slightly better but it 's a good deal if you get it on sale ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous ! i really loved it until i put it on . wow it was bad . i ordered a small -- normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material . it was n't long but rather incredibly boxy . one of the most unflattering things i 've ever tried at retailer ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me . the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired . the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big . the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top . for reference i am 5'10 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top . i think an xs would have been to"

__label__0 "it 's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory . looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color . the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester slightly scratchy feel . sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat ."

__label__0 "this is one of those dresses that is just nice and can be one that you go to in a pinch .... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down . it 's not the best quality in fabric ... but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs . i like it it fits well ... it 's not outstanding or unusual . i think it is a bit pricey for what you get ... but it 's a work horse dress ... it will do you right whenever you need it to !"
__label__-1 "ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box . tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist . within minutes of wearing the waist fell down past my hips ... glad i was at home . looks cute but will not stay up ."

__label__0 "i love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist . i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable . the quality is ok something i feel i would see at another type of discount store . for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this ... it 's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but that 's where the positives end . i ordered the xs and it was huge . wide shapeless and way too long ( i 'm 105lbs and 5 ' 1 ) . even if it came in petite i 'm not sure it 's worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out ."
__label__0 "really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit . fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me ."
__label__1 "i fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it . it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it did n't matter . i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days . this is one of my new favorites !"
__label__1 "this shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling . the material looks very nice and seems well made . it has a nice length to it so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry . i 'm a 36d and ca n't get the button to close properly so i 'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you . overall it will be a very versitile piece i 'm excited to add to my wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress and loved everything about it ! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big . they were out of the smaller size so i had to return it . the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture ."
__label__-1 "was excited to receive this dress as it had some great reviews . however of the love was coming from the 5 ' 5+ set . as a petite this did n't work well for me and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way . returned ."

__label__0 "loved the look quality was great but did n't work for me . too busy and off-fitting . i did return ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of . if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only . also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to keep this dress and the material is amazing so soft and gentle and delicate the design is great the front looks nice but from back looks really awkward big and kind of too loose !"
__label__-1 "the jeans look so different online ! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut . the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches ! also i 'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27 but the legs are super skinny . i 'm so disappointed and i 'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size . these look more like men 's cut jeans ."

__label__-1 "i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress . this was not it . completely see through . i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up . but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip . its an odd design . absolutely not worth the price . i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress . returned this piece without looking back"
__label__0 "gorgeous but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart . for $ 218 and it ca n't even make it out of the store intact ? i love the look but did n't want it to fall apart . they should 've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim . such a shame ! !"

__label__1 "my favorite pair of ags . i normally wear sz26 but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ankle length on me . i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe . it does n't seem like they 've stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want . i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down ."
__label__0 "i loved this when i got it . it has such a flattering fit ! slightly loose in the body but not flowy . nice weight of fabric . comfortable fabric . perfect scoop neck that does n't show too much cleavage . but i washed it once on delicate and line dried ( which i do with most of my shirts ) and it came out riddled in holes ."
__label__1 "i saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on . it is a beautifully made dress . lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket . feels very boho and chic . i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress . i was almost turned off by the price but decided to see it in person . worth every penny . wear it with sandals or tall boots could have worn a medium but a little tight for 38c on top ."
__label__0 "as a petite big busted woman i found this dress wildly unflattering . the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent . the design of the bust however i found unflattering ."
__label__-1 "this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing . i love the overall design and colors . however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy ! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be . in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large - almost too oversized . the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big . it 's too bad i really loved the look but i 'm not the type to layer . if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would !"
__label__0 "i wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off . it stretched so much . i 'm going to beg my local store to take back . it should n't fall apart like that . it 's super duper cozy though ."

__label__0 "i usually wear a small 4 or 6 and in this dress i could n't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest . if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger . guess this one is not for me ."
__label__-1 "dress appears to be slim fit but that 's far from the case . usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5 ' 3 but it just hung on me like a heavy sack . i have a hard time finding dresses now that i 'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions -- weddings memorials special occasions . i hoped this one would meet my needs . disappointed ."
__label__1 "button down shirts usually are n't my thing but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look . it 's also easy to dress up or down which is great ! i am 5 ' 4 and small-framed and the size 0 fits just right ."
__label__1 "a must have 1 piece . every time i wear this i get compliments ! it 's very flattering amazing quality soft material good support and vibrant colors ! i wish this came in more colors and patterns . worth the money no questions asked !"

__label__1 "this an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it . i 'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material . i would n't want to discourage anyone from trying it ."

__label__-1 "i read the other review that said the shirt was boxy i did n't think it would be a terribly big deal . unfortunately it is . normally i wear a size s so i sized down o an xs . the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline but the shirt is still very box and now super short . unfortunately this is going back . not a good fit . adorable details but the fit is terrible ."
__label__0 "i like the idea of the dress just not the fit in the bust . i 'm not particularly big ( 32c ) but it just did n't fit up there . i wish the dress had built in support because you ca n't really wear a bra ."
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 8 small 115 pounds . ordered the xs . this dress is gorgeous ! my husband loved it ! i tried several sticky bras ... nothing worked . i 'm 32dd i gave up . if your ok with no support you 'll love this dress . sexy back perfect length so light !"

__label__-1 "love the color and overall design of this dress ... but it 's just going to have to go back . the view from the direct front and back are nice but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant . not the look i 'm going for especially at this price . the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed ! in the back it 's all i see which is 'right ' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front . i do n't know how the designer missed this ! it 's the only white design on th"

__label__0 "this dress looked amazing in the picture . i am 5'10 and since the model was 5 ' 9 with the dress dragging on the ground i assumed it would be long on me as well . even with flats this dress is an awkward length . the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it 's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great . it just does n't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length ."
__label__1 "this top was very pretty when i got it but i was hoping it would be a bit longer . the v neck design was nice and the fabric very soft . i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine ."
__label__1 "these fit quite well and it 's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight . great for spring or summer . fits tts ."
__label__0 "this shirt runs extremely large . looks boxy and unflattering ."
__label__0 "the top as with most of ap 's tops is well stitched . material is very uncomfortable . if you have large bust it is a little divulging . this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top !"
__label__1 "i got this for my daughter ( teen ) who had been wanting this plaid look but did n't want to look like a lumberjack ! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down . it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable ! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase ! new item but black friday discount ! yay ! purchased in red color ."
__label__-1 "bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack . washed them according to directions and they were ruined . the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled . definitely going to try to return these ."
__label__1 "i agree with everything the other reviewer stated . this top is very billowy and runs large it would be nice if i did n't have a chest ! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber . the pink is slightly more pink in person but it 's not that far off . had to return ."
__label__0 "usually i am a huge meadow rue fan but not this time . the print is okay but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft . if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt but since it was neither it was returned ?"
__label__0 "i 'm all over this trend but this vest is quite thick/poufy and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball . i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best . on me a sweater vest would perhaps be better . i am chesty . but i cant decide . its really cute ! if you 're taller than 5 ' 4 do n't hesitate ."

__label__1 "after reading reviews i ordered a medium instead of a large even though i am typically a size 12. it was definitely the right decision . a very flattering dress in a beautiful color . if you order in the right size it is not at all dowdy . it is forgiving in the belly area which is great for me . it can be worn with tights or without tights so really quite versatile . i am sure that i will wear it a lot . also it is very comfortable ."

__label__0 "this dress is very good quality with beautiful beading on the bodice . it 's a heavier material than i was expecting but that was a pleasant surprise . unfortunately when i put it on and looked in the mirror i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid . the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and combined with the overall design and length i could n't think of anywhere to wear it . this is an easy return for me . the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit"
__label__1 "i love this dress i love the style i love the pattern i love the feel of the fabric . there 's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me . however i think it runs a little large particularly because it 's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature and it 's a great one : this dress ( and your figure ) needs it . i am 135 pounds 5 ' 5 and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should 've known to try a small but i went with my usual size in dresses"
__label__0 "i purchased this on sale xxs petite and i 'm glad i did . it 's an adorable sweater but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city ! bummer . i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped . it 's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute . looks really soft and cozy but i would say itchy and cozy !"
__label__0 "i have several pairs of coh and love them all . when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them . however when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long . meaning they go well below your butt cheeks ( like 3 # which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they are n't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh ! i thought perhaps it was my perception that day so i waited an"
__label__1 "super soft and cute . the buttons add a nice touch . the color depicted online gave me pause but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic . great investment . beautiful sweater . 34c 65 135 and the small is perfect ."
__label__-1 "i 'm usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad . the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest . the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way ."
__label__0 "gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular ."
__label__0 "interesting slightly transparent fabric . neckline is not so open as pictured . body is boxier than pictured . would recommend as a maybe ."
__label__1 "i purchased the gorgeous green color . i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it 's cooler outside . the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in ! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it !"
__label__-1 "i loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape i was frustrated that it did n't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head . the fabric was stiff and seemed to be lace over cotton ? not entirely sure . i could n't get past the feeling off the material ."
__label__0 "first off the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top . the material is thick and pleasant feeling the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done . however i just could n't get past the fit issue which was also mentioned by the other reviewers . i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest and it was loose in all the wrong places . i 'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me but i 'm afraid it would be too snug . this may look awesome on someone else but i had to ret"
__label__1 "this shirt is beautiful and well-made . the lace is soft - not scratchy at all . looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath ."
__label__0 "cute but too thick and rough"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this but it was just too voluminous to be flattering . i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits and the medium was billowing around me . also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way . it had to go back ."
__label__-1 "i ca n't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric . i do n't consider that high-quality ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to try this on in the store because i 've had my eye on it online . unfortunately it is not like the picture . the material is very thin almost translucent . i also could not figure out how it get it on ! the cape has short sleeves not long as it appears in the picture and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front . love the look of black design on white . hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall but for now i 'll skip this one ."
__label__0 "the material is awesome and it 's a super pretty dress it just did n't work on my body ."
__label__-1 "much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo . when i pulled it out of the package i thought i 'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow . but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly with beautiful detail and high quality material but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape . it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion . it does n't look anything like the phot"
__label__0 "bought these for the color however these just did not work for me . the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy . i 'm 5 ' 3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim . if you are looking for a looser fit more of a straight leg fit ... this is a good jean with a fun pop of color ."
__label__1 "this tee is versatile soft well made and it washes/dries well . i love longer length and stripe pocket details . it runs true to size and it is a beautiful dark navy blue . what more can i ask for ?"
__label__-1 "the pants are pretty and run true to size but the fabric is bathing suit like very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat . i would n't recommend for anything but waking ."
__label__1 "this top is comfort wear or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work . because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer . that said it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it . i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable"
__label__1 "this is a great top ! i love the color of the pink ... it is the perfect color of pink ; not too bright or too light but a pretty pink-coral spring color ! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on . i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect . i am 5 ' 2 and 110lbs . i usually get petite but i ca n't imagine this shirt being shorter ... it 's a great length . i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy . it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there . love it ! perfect fo"
__label__-1 "i loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body . it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections . bottom of pants are not hemmed so if you want a clean look you may not like the edges . these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me ."
__label__1 "adorable jacket . i ordered the medium ( 5 ' 4 135 lbs ) . sleeves are long and have to roll them up . ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better . pink color is great ."
__label__0 "this is a pretty dress . i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit however the sleeves were too long . had to return as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me ."
__label__-1 "i made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews . cute design but not as comfy as it looks . returned immediately ."
__label__0 "this is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it . the fit is great love the side zippers . i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed . nothing i cant get rid of ( till next time i carry a bag ! ) but if this keeps up there soon wo n't be much of a shirt left . very disappointing for the price . was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality ."
__label__-1 "i bought this online so did n't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very very stiff . i was expecting something silky or at least on the softer and more moveable side . the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt . that being the case it kind of juts out in weird places . the sweater part is very nice but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture . the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o"
__label__-1 "disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $ 128 they are asking i would be a tad skewed . not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling . does n't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer . i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again . big loser ."
__label__0 "i tried this dress in an xs ( my usual size ) and it is tts . i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty . however the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me . i didn & # 39 ; t get the dress and wished it worked out ."
__label__1 "softest denim -- they feel like they 've been through the wash a hundred times already ! i 'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me . i 'm 5 ' 4 and bought the petite for a perfect fit . these will become a go-to pair !"
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"
__label__0 "i personally love this romper . there 's a lot of fabric to it so it feels lush and substantial . and the pockets ! they 're so roomy i actually could n't find my phone for a hot second . the crotch of the legs ( because yes this thing is actually pants ) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting . the two things i do n't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo : not bathroom-break friendly . you basically have to disrobe . and since the legs are so long you end up clingi"
__label__0 "nicely made pretty details but it 's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy . wore with orange linen pants and it was cute !"
__label__1 "this looks just like the picture . it 's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots . love it !"
__label__-1 "i love the color of this dress . it is not flattering even though it should be . the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky . the lace is heavy but the silky panels are n't . so not flattering it 's just odd . and the fit is super huge you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape . it could have been so cute but was executed so poorly ."
__label__-1 "quality was not what you expect from retailer especially for the price . top is lined but skirt is not . material is tissue paper thin and see thru . there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat it keeps popping up . however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives . was returned ."
__label__1 "i love this fabric it is comfortable and forgiving . as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great . i wish it would be offered in red like the cowl neck long sleeve tee . with that said i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd and while i wish it were a few inches longer ( 3/4 sleeved ) . the only reason i have n't given it five stars is that i have n't laundered it enough to verify the quality ."
__label__1 "now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done . there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points : great fit flattering silhouette comfortable fabric shape enhancing cut and the easiest casual style ever ! i got the 10p and my body is 5 ' 3 140 # 36dd"
__label__-1 "this sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest . it 's very well made but not for the curvy girl . this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others ' reviews before i purchase ."
__label__1 "this is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep . wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath ."
__label__0 "i am tall and typically wear a size 10/12 so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted . but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic . it fits like a poncho . with my arms at my sides it fit me similar to the model picture . but if i lift my arms ( to use them ) then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me . the reason for that is that it does n't really have sleeves - it 's more like hol"
__label__-1 "this is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye . the dyes in these pants are the same thing . i wore the purple color and washed in cold gentle cycle and they were stained/ i will return these -it 's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants ."
__label__1 "love my jeans fit great and very flattering . they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit . receive compliments every time i wear them . if they go on sale i will buy another . : )"
__label__-1 "the shirt is absolutely cute looking . but that 's just that .... looks . i 'm 5 ' 2 size 6 & wears m to l top . i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing . i liked it . but i did n't like how it fit on the underarm area . it hung very low . so i ordered a petite m. still the same . plus the store the lighting was dark so i did n't realize how see through the shirt was too . had to return it ."
__label__-1 "this shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging . the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much ."
__label__1 "cute casual drawstring short . runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look . nice length for long legs ."
__label__-1 "this dress hangs like a sack . it really needs a belt to give it some shape . i tried to style it with one but then did n't look right either . i did like the slip that came with it . i 'll be returning it ."
__label__0 "this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline . but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area -- so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty . a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just did n't feel comfortable about . some darts could have made a nicer fit here . but this is a a great dress if you do n't mind a super body con fit ."
__label__1 "this dress intrigued me a bit online but not enough to order it to try it . even on the rack i was n't so sure about it but decided to try it this afternoon . i could n't have been more pleased . it is fresh flattering flowy light and beautiful . even though there is quite a bit of fabric the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering . i did n't realize this came in blue as well . i may add that one to my wishlist but the red one is a definite winner . it will make a great"
__label__-1 "unfortunately this top is shirt-length and i 'm only 5 ' 4 . needs to be about 6 longer . made of sweatshirt material which i would n't mind if it were longer . also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in the plum color which in real life just looks like a very very dark brown . that would probably be okay but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements . i ordered the regular length but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh ... way way too short . i am 5 ' 5 for reference . lastly i think the fabric is just awful quality especially for this price point . the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
__label__-1 "i thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on and i was majorly disappointed . it was incredibly unflattering in every way . as a few of the other reviewers mentioned if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant . i 'm 5 ' 2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer but this ... ewww ! i will say the color and material are gorgeous but i 'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes"
__label__1 "absolutely amazing ! a must staple in every one 's closet this season . i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel . the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on"
__label__0 "this shirt is cute nice cut but i do n't love it . best as a sleeping tank ."
__label__1 "i am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues . i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive . this swimsuit does the trick . makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat . love this suit ! ! !"
__label__-1 "saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on . i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia . i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people . too much fabric in the peplum part ."
__label__-1 "legs are too wide . the fabric is rough to the touch ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress ... tried it on one size down from my usual ... it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock . it 's stunning and i love it ... i badly have to have it ... please bring it back retailer : )"
__label__0 "loved this top on model . even happier when it went on sale . sort of boxy . but still excited then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric ! disappointed . my other tees i purchased are fine ."
__label__1 "although it kind of ran big and the material is stiff causing some protrusion off my shoulders i decided to keep it only because it was unique and still looked cute"
__label__-1 "it 's short and wide . not a good combo for anyone who is n't stick thin ."
__label__-1 "first it 's huge . i 'm not big busted but it 's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant . not exactly what i was going for . nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in -- and i 'm short waisted so no tucking for me . back it went ."
__label__0 "this just did not sit well on me . while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch the twist at the shoulder just looked odd . it did not sit flat at all so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves . given the spot-on quality i would definitely look into other items from this brand but back this dress went ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! yes it is quite transparent but just needs a light colored cami ( i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer ) ! it 's incredibly soft and light for summer time . the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern . i also really like the sewn in v-neck line . it gives the shirt a more professional touch . i 'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer ."
__label__-1 "i was very excited about this product . when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest . when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small . i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest . also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected . the print is just as lovely in person as it is online . i do n't even know if sizing up will mak"
__label__1 "i like these pants . they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me . my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture . the print is what drew me to these pants . the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received . they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i do n't think they would be worth it at full price ."
__label__-1 "the other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite . i am 5 ' 4 and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered . the length was not what made me send them back though . the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick stretchy and well made . however the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material . if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great"
__label__1 "this dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress . can pair with blazer or sweater and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback . zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top but overall i 'm really happy with this dress !"
__label__0 "i absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece . the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer . however ; this runs really large . in general this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand . however ; compared to other brands it runs very large . i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size . it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a"
__label__-1 "i do n't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine . i also ordered the xs even though i 'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked . already returned it . on the plus side it 's gorgeous ."
__label__1 "love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint ! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle ... in a great way . the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters . i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them ... they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again . i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests ... in a contrast print would be incredible"
__label__0 "i have the blue and gray and love the look and feel . however the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas ."
__label__1 "while there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head i did not find it to be too difficult . i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day ! it 's quite comfortable too . i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size !"
__label__-1 "this shirt was great for one wear . after just one wash ( followed instructions to dry clean ) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet . terrible waste of money on a pricey top ."
__label__0 "i ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews . it is more like marroon . i am very disappointed . the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality . it is long and has the belt at the back but the fit and quality overall are very plain . it looks a tad dowdy . i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings . but it is definitely not dressy . perhaps white may not look as bad . the plain design and marroon dull color do n't help ."
__label__1 "this cover up has great potential . i love the embroidery . the colors and design are great . however it has a number of loose strings . it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it . the fabric is on the thinner side but it is not see through . the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool . i caught it on sale so i am keeping it ."
__label__1 "absolutely gorgeous ! i bought my regular size m and while it 's a little wide in the shoulders it drapes beautifully . because i 'm so short i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it 's still elbow length and while i was there she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame . ca n't wait to wear it - it 's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet . so elegant . very gatsby"
__label__-1 "this top could 've been one of my favorites ever . i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color . the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank . unfortunately after 2 wears several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle . i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry . when i came to read the reviews i noticed i was n't the only customer with this issue ."
__label__0 "i thought this dress was very cute on the model however it was way too tight across the chest for me . going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else . also fabric was n't great ."
__label__1 "love love love this dress ! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect . great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots . i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket . i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well . buy this dress - you wo n't regret it !"
__label__-1 "even on my 5 ' 1 short-waisted 100 lb body this was super short . it was also super boxy . not flattering at all . the blue was a good color but this is going back ."
__label__-1 "i have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful ! in addition to it having no give feeling like it will stretch out and being slightly see-through it is super scratchy ! ! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric .. awful !"
__label__-1 "like some other reviewers i too have to comment on the dress 's fit . the dress does n't fit right around the bust or the waist . as a seamstress myself i know that the problem is that it does n't have any darts in the bust and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size . this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right . while a belt helps i do n't think it helps enough to justify the price . it 's too bad -- i think the concept of it is cool and i was rea"
__label__-1 "i purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet . the style is very cute but the fabric is quite thin . she will have to make that call but if i had bought it for myself it would be going back . i 'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt . it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it 's washed so that remains to be seen ."
__label__-1 "i own 4-5 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material . this one missed the mark . not soft and very thick . not what i was expecting ."
__label__-1 "so wanted great pair of sweater leggings ... great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple . these are not that . these fit very poorly ... i ordered the small which is more like a large one in the waistline ... there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them . unfortunately i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~"
__label__1 "this top is cute ! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality . the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy . as another reviewer pointed out the peplum is only in the front ! it sounds really weird but i do n't really mind the look because i 'll be wearing a jacket over it . i 'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but i think the proportions are very weird . i 'm 5 ' 7 and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses . it runs small throughout and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work . the front is nicely detailed but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing . i tried on three different sizes ( 8 10 and 12 ) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest . there 's a little slip that goes with the dress w"
__label__0 "i love this dress the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled ! once i washed it ( yes its washable ) it looked fantastic ! ! !"
__label__0 "i had been eyeing this top for weeks . it 's look so beautiful on the model however not great on me . material is fab . the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material ."
__label__0 "i tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note . it 's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store . also it 's unlined . i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined . given its hem i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too ."
__label__0 "i love how this dress is photographed but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed . there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever . the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on . this one is going back ."
__label__0 "it 's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house . it 's comfy and i like the detail of the back . the front is very plain but okay . it 's not too baggy and it 's a straight cut . the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store ."
__label__0 "this romper fits well and is flattering . i love the relaxed style . the quality is quite poor though . one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric while soft and comfortable is fraying and pilling like crazy . after only two brief wears the romper looks cheap and old . i expect much better quality at this pricepoint . really disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this blouse so much . but try as i might it just fit so oddly on me . i 'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown . first . the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second the fit was off . maybe i just got a bad one but the center of the blouse was so offset that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it . the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an"
__label__0 "this is a very pretty jacket . light weight and perfect for spring/fall . i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store . i did end up returning it though . it does run large i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look ! i was sad to have to send this one back ! i was hoping to love it ! someone smaller might love it ! !"
__label__1 "i a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket . the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design . be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge . i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue ."
